**Level of Achievement**
Apollo

**Motivation**
As lovers of 2D pixel-art games as well as traditional platformer style games, making our own game that combines these 2 elements has always been on our bucket list.

(We want players to experience a retro-style looking game that has the smooth and sharp mechanics of modern platformers (e.g Metroid Dread and Ori franchise). We also wanted players to experience a game that is unique: offering special mechanics and a playstyle that is not restricted to a certain linear flow.)

**Game Ideation**
We took inspiration from Metroidvania games for their non-linearity game progression as well as classic 2D pixel-art games for their retro style graphics.

*In Metroid Dread, obstacles that require power ups not yet acquired such as Grapple Beam (as shown above) are introduced in the game early on, requiring players to go back to previous locations once acquiring certain abilities*

## Art
Oslo was intentionally designed to look plain as his source of power doesn't come from within himself but the orbs he possesses.

Orbs grant Oslo his power and are meant to contrast Oslo with flashy visuals and colours

# Gameplay
## story
The story starts in NoWay, Oslo's hometown. Oslo is part of a long running lineage of monks in NoWay who maintains the balance of the world. Right before Oslo is about to succeed his father as head monk, portals spawned all over the world, causing monsters to be unleashed across the worlds! Oslo must travel the world to acquire the elemental orbs that are essential to the balance of the world and use them to seal the portals once and for all.

## Abilities
Oslo harnesses the power of the elemental orbs for combat with his enemy. He starts off with the Air orb he claims from the monastery and gains Air-related powers such as double jump and air strike (a normal melee attack).

As he clears enemies and gains access to other elements, Oslo gains other abilities such as elemental missiles. Previous abilities such as air strike could be imbued with new elements for new and different effects.
